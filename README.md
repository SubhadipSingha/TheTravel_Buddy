I have developed a simple travel-guiding tool/website that helps users discover tourist spots in any district, state, or country.
Users only need to enter the place name, and the tool will assist them in finding and saving potential destinations.
They can later track these saved places and remove them after completing their journey.

This basic tool is designed to be helpful for people who love to explore tourist spots but find it challenging to navigate through the vast amount of information available on Google.
By filtering out irrelevant results, TripMapper provides users with specific and effective recommendations.
